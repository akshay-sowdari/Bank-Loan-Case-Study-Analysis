# Bank-Loan-Case-Study-Analysis
This project aims to apply exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques in a real business scenario to develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services. The objective is to understand how data can be used to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
The case study revolves around a consumer finance company that specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to the people due to their insufficient or non-existent credit history, which results in some consumers becoming defaulters. The company has to use EDA to analyze the patterns present in the data and ensure that the applicants capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.
